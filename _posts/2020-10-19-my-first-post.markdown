## This is a first title

# This is a second title

This is normal text, and yes, im learning about **markdown** *language*.

With triple left quote we can put code, like this:

```
if (english != null)
    printf("You will get a joob");
else
    printf("You will need to improve your english");
```
To do a list without numbers:
- First
- Second
- Third
- Fourth

But if you want a list with numbers, you can do this:
1. Number one
2. Number two
3. Number three
4. Number four
